    <!-- Send files here for analysis.

    Note that the certificate of the analysis (AQA) host should be put in the static/certificates 
    directory.  This is required to support secure communications.  If the 
    certificate is not present, then this process will be unable to talk to the 
    host.  If the static/certificates directory is empty, then this process will 
    trust all hosts, which is a very bad security policy but can be useful for 
    debugging HTTPS connection problems.

    To get the certificate of the host, visit it with a web browser and the
    right click, get page information, and then security information.  It
    may be necessary to view details.  Certificate files will usually have the .pem or 
    .cer suffix.  This service supports both.   Different browsers interface 
    will vary.
